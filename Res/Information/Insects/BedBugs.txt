General Facts:

Bedbugs, scientifically known as Cimex lectularius, are small parasitic insects that feed on the blood of humans and animals.
They are wingless insects with flat, oval bodies, and are typically brown or reddish-brown.
Bedbugs are excellent at hiding in cracks, crevices, and other secluded areas.
They are most active at night and feed on their host's blood while they sleep.
Bedbugs can go several months without feeding, depending on environmental conditions.
These pests are highly adaptable and can be found in many parts of the world.
Bedbugs do not transmit diseases, but their bites can cause itching and discomfort.
The mere presence of bedbugs can be a source of stress and anxiety for homeowners.
Where to Find Bedbugs:

Bedbugs are often found in places where people rest or sleep, such as homes, hotels, and hostels.
They can be found in bedding, mattresses, box springs, and bed frames.
Bedbugs can also infest upholstery, curtains, and carpeted areas.
Common hiding spots include cracks in walls, furniture, and electrical outlets.
Infestations can occur in theaters, public transportation, and office buildings.
Bedbugs can hide in suitcases, purses, and clothing, making them easy to transport from one location to another.
They are not exclusive to beds but can infest other furniture and areas where people spend time.
How to Look for Bedbugs:

Inspect the seams and folds of mattresses, box springs, and bedding for live bedbugs or their shed exoskeletons.
Examine cracks and crevices in the bed frame and headboard.
Check behind wallpaper, picture frames, and in electrical outlets.
Inspect upholstered furniture and curtains for signs of infestation.
Examine the seams and folds of luggage and backpacks after traveling.
Pay attention to any signs of bites on your skin and look for small, itchy, red welts.
Keep an eye out for tiny reddish-brown bugs crawling on surfaces, especially at night.
Use a flashlight to inspect hidden areas, as bedbugs are nocturnal and active in the dark.
Look for small, black fecal spots on sheets, mattresses, or nearby furniture.
Bedbugs can emit a sweet, musty odor, so pay attention to any unusual smells.
Evidence of Bedbug Presence:

Bedbug bites are a common sign of their presence. Bites often appear in clusters or rows, are itchy, and may develop into red welts.
Tiny, reddish-brown bugs crawling on surfaces or hiding in cracks and crevices are a strong indicator of bedbugs.
Bedbug exoskeletons, which are shed as they grow, can be found in hiding spots or on bedding.
Small, black or brown fecal spots on sheets, mattresses, or other surfaces indicate bedbug activity.
Bloodstains on bedding or pajamas may result from bedbugs being accidentally crushed during feeding.
Musty, sweet odor may be noticeable in areas with a significant bedbug infestation.
Bedbug eggs are tiny and white, about the size of a pinhead, and may be found in cracks and crevices.
Lifecycle and Behavior:

Bedbugs go through several life stages, including egg, nymph, and adult.
Nymphs are smaller and lighter in color than adults.
Nymphs molt several times before reaching adulthood.
Adult bedbugs are about the size of an apple seed.
A single female bedbug can lay hundreds of eggs in her lifetime.
Bedbugs typically feed every five to ten days, but they can survive longer without a blood meal.
They prefer to feed on exposed skin while their host is asleep.
Bedbugs inject saliva that acts as an anesthetic, so hosts often do not feel the bites.
Bedbug bites can result in various skin reactions, ranging from mild itching to severe allergic reactions.
Scratching bedbug bites can lead to secondary infections.
Reproduction:

Bedbugs reproduce through traumatic insemination, where the male pierces the female's abdomen to transfer sperm.
Female bedbugs can lay eggs individually or in clusters.
Eggs are laid in hidden locations, making them challenging to detect.
The eggs hatch into nymphs, which molt several times before becoming adults.
Reproduction is temperature-dependent, with higher temperatures accelerating development.
Lifecycle:

The lifecycle of a bedbug involves several stages: egg, nymph (five instars), and adult.
Nymphs closely resemble adult bedbugs but are smaller and lighter in color.
Molting occurs after each nymph stage until adulthood is reached.
Nymphs require blood meals to molt and grow.
The entire lifecycle, from egg to adult, typically takes several weeks to months.
Mating:

Mating among bedbugs often occurs in hiding spots or close to where they feed.
Males pierce the female's abdomen to inseminate her, resulting in traumatic insemination.
A single insemination can allow the female to lay eggs throughout her life.
Bedbugs are known to mate shortly after reaching adulthood.
